# Forkify-Project
## Background
(A website)[https://verumemanio.github.io/Forkify-Project/] that uses a recipe API to generate search results and load recipe instructions. You can also add recipe ingredients to a shopping list and track your favorite recipes using local storage. The HTML and CSS were provided by a Udemy course, but all of the JS is mine. I used Babel and Webpack for this project.

## How to use the site
<b>Search for a recipe</b>
1. In the search bar, type a keyword, like pizza, and click Search. The page will load a list of recipes related to pizza.

<b>Load a recipe from the search results</b>
1. Click on a recipe listed in the sidebar on the left side of the page.

<b>Add a recipe's ingredients to your shopping list</b>
1. Click Add to Shopping List. The page will add the currently loaded recipe's ingredients to your shopping list.

<b>Delete an ingredient from your shopping list</b>
1. Hover over an ingredient in the list, and then click the orange x that appears. The page will remove the ingredient from your shopping list.

<b>Add a recipe to your list of favorites</b>
