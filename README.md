# Forkify-Project
<b>Background</b><br>
A website that uses a recipe API to generate a shopping list, list ingredients, and track your favorite recipes. The HTML and CSS were provided by a Udemy course, but all of the JS is mine. I used Babel and Webpack for this project.

<b>How to use</b><br>
Still in progress!
