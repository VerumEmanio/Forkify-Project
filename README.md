# Forkify-Project
## Background
A website that uses a recipe API to generate search results and load recipe instructions. You can also add recipe ingredients to a shopping list and track your favorite recipes using local storage. The HTML and CSS were provided by a Udemy course, but all of the JS is mine. I used Babel and Webpack for this project.

## How to use the site
### Search for a recipe
1. In the search bar, type a keyword, like pizza, and click Search. The page will load a list of recipes related to pizza.

### Load a recipe from the search results
1. Click on a recipe listed in the sidebar on the left side of the page.

### Add a recipe's ingredients to your shopping list
1. Click Add to Shopping List. The page will add the currently loaded recipe's ingredients to your shopping list.

### Delete an ingredient from your shopping list
1. Hover over an ingredient in the list, and then click the orange x that appears. The page will remove the ingredient from your shopping list.

### View recipe cooking directions
1. Click Directions. The original website containing the recipe will open in a new tab.

### Add a recipe to your list of favorites
1. Load that recipe from the search results.
2. Click the heart below the recipe title.

### View your list of favorite recipes
1. Hover over the heart in the upper right corner of the page.
